# RSS Aggregator

A lightweight fullstack web application for subscribing to and reading RSS channels.  
Built with Next.js (frontend), Hono (backend via RPC) and secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## ‚ú® Features
### üßë Accounts & Authentication
- Credential auth flow
- JWT with access and refresh tokens with silent refresh
- Admin accounts which can add new and refresh existing RSS channel on demand

### üìö RSS Channels & Items
- A curated list of predefined RSS channels available to all users
- Channels and items follow strictly [RSS 2.0 Specification](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification)
- Users can subscribe or unsubscribe from available channels
- Each user can manage their personal list of subscribed channels
- Channel items are cached and stored in MongoDB for efficient delivery
- Periodic background refresh of channel items (e.g. every 30 minutes)

## Environment Configuration
To generate secure ``JWT_SIGNING_SECRET`` and ``JWT_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`` values, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"
```

Run the command twice and assign the first output to ``JWT_SIGNING_SECRET``, and the second to ``JWT_ENCRYPTION_SECRET``.

Example ``.env`` file:
```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
JWT_SIGNING_SECRET=your_generated_signing_secret
JWT_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=your_generated_encryption_secret
```

## Access + Refresh token

> This is practical implementation of token-based authentication described in my blog post here:
> https://witoldzawada.dev/blog/jwt-vs-session 

The application uses a dual-token strategy for authentication.  
The Next.js frontend seamlessly and automatically refreshes the `access_token` when a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response is encountered.  
The Hono backend ‚Äî integrated as Next.js API Routes ‚Äî handles all application-level API logic.

Below are the technical details of the implementation:

### üîë Access Token

- **Purpose:** Used to authenticate API requests
- **Algorithm:** Signed with ``HS256``
- **Header:** 
```json
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
```
- **Payload:** 
```json
{
    "sub": "user_id",
    "name": "Username",
    "email": "useremail@example.com",
    "jti": "random_token_id",
    "iat": 1712345678,
    "exp": 1712349278
}
```
- **Storage:** Sent as a ``HttpOnly`` cookie named ``access_token``
- **Expiry:** Short-lived (e.g., 5 minutes)

### üîê Refresh Token

- **Purpose:** Used to obtain a new ``access_token`` when the current one expires
- **Algorithm:** Encrypted using ``A256GCM`` (``alg: "dir", enc: "A256GCM"``).
- **Header:** 
```json
{
    "alg": "dir",
    "enc": "A256GCM"
}
```
- **Payload:** 
```json
{
    "sub": "user_id",
    "jti": "random_token_id",
    "iat": 1712345678,
    "exp": 1714937678
}
```
- **Storage:** Sent as a ``HttpOnly`` cookie named ``refresh_token``
- **Expiry:** Long-lived (e.g., 30 days)

## üîê Security Notes
- Common cookie options include:
    - ``httpOnly: true``
    - ``sameSite: Strict``
    - ``path: '/'``
    - ``secure: true (for production)/false (for development)``
- Refresh tokens are encrypted to prevent visibility and tampering.
- Access tokens are signed and contain user identification data for fast verification without DB access.
- On token refresh, the access token is re-issued, and the refresh token remains valid until expiry or logout.
